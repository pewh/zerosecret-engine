# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First source release under Apache-2.0. No crates.io packages and no binaries.

- `zs`, the agent CLI. It runs a workload without credentials and adds them to outbound
  requests that a signed grant allows.
- Brokered protocols: HTTP and HTTPS (header injection and AWS SigV4 signing), PostgreSQL,
  MySQL and MongoDB.
- `zs-verify`, which reports whether a credential value reached the workload's environment,
  files or arguments.
- `zs-conformance`, the protocol conformance suite, with the AWS SigV4 test vectors.
